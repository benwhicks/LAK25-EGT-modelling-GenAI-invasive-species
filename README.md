# Game-theoretic models of intangible learning data

The idea for this modelling experiment was to model genAI as an invasive species into peer-feedback learning environments.

The code for the animations in the slide deck can be found [here](https://github.com/benwhicks/LAK25-EGT-modelling-GenAI-invasive-species/blob/main/plots-for-LAK25-slides.R). This contains a slightly different implementation of the use of GenAI - rather than an indiviudal strategy it is an environment parameter that dictates the overall use of GenAI for generating feedback.
